# 🌳 Hello all, and thank you for visiting my github 🌳

## Cameron Zimmerman | Full Stack Software Engineer

I love the exploration and the aspects of human nature that coding embody, I am currently learning Next.js, .NET framework, and C#. I have the ability to make or break someone's day, so I bring my best self every day. I strive to firstly be kind, so I can help others and bring them up. In each role I will or have had, I believe my tenacity and positivity are my most appreciated trait. Open on collabs on projects of all kinds! I am also seeking a full time Software Engineering position.
